    <h1>A Video Review</h1>
    
    <h2>“Don’t Fear the Internet”</h2>
    <h3>by Russ Maschmeyer (aka ‘Strange Native’)</h3>
    <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
    <p>The Internet influences many aspects of our daily lives in society today. As such, it is important to know how the Internet and websites work. Ignorance is no excuse when it come to a vastly used resource and commodity. </p>
    <p>I really enjoyed the  <a href="http://vimeo.com/24006296">"Don't Fear the Internet"</a> tutorial videos. Russ Maschmeyer (aka ‘Strange Native’) has a very articulate voice and does an excellent job of explaining and teaching about the Internet, websites, HTML, CSS, and more. I would definitely recommend these videos to anyone attempting to learn HTML or CSS, or to anyone who simply wants to learn more about how website work and are designed. The tutorials can empower non-web designers and make them more comfortable with the platform they are now manipulating.</p>
    <p>These tutorial videos reaffirmed wheat I have been learning in Web Design class. Furthermore, Russ Maschmeyer has taught me that I don't need to be a designer, photographer, or creative person to build my own (good-looking) website.</p>
    <h4>Three Things I learned:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>A website is a series of files stored on a server, located at a web address, that anyone can find with a computer. There are two kinds of websites: static and dynamic.</li>
        <li>CSS has a limited set of properties that can be used to style (just like HTML has a limited set of elements that define content types).</li>
        <li>Pseudo elements can be added on to the selector properties used in CSS to style specific parts or properties of an element.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>“10 Things I Didn’t Know About HTML”</h2>
    <h3>by Mathias Bynens</h3>
    <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
    <p>In his presentation, <a href="http://vimeo.com/89935203">“10 Things I Didn’t Know About HTML”</a>, Mathias Bynens explained how certain elements, attribute entities, notations, and tags can be used or omitted to make HTML documents valid. </p>
    <p>Mathias Bynens asserts that it is important to have a HTML or CSS validation website check your written code, it is also crucial to have a human check it as there are many mistakes that can be made which will be read as valid by a program but are incorrect. For example, quoted attributes, elements not included in DTD, and end tags.</p>
    <p>In my opinion, this video was very complex and used language that I, a non-web designer, didn't understand much of the language was complicated hard to follow. It was like reading/listening to a different language (which it kind of is). But, nonetheless, it was a very informative video and I did learn quite a lot about HTML that I didn't know before.</p>
    <h4>Three Things I learned:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Browsers will automatically render tags (which are optional in the mark up). Therefore, you can have a valid HTML document with missing end tags.</li>
        <li>Quotes, single quotes, and unquoted attribute values are all valid in HTML if an attribute value has no spaces.</li>
        <li>DTD (Document Type Definition) contains the elements, attribute entities, notations, and tags used in a HTML document. Without using DTD a HTML document would not be valid.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>“Front End Legos: Better Design with Reusable HTML & CSS”</h2>
    <h3>by Shay Howe</h3>
    <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
    <p>CSS code is a method of separating presentation and content. This separation improves content accessibility, provide more control of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages, and reduce complexity and repetition.</p>
    <p>In Shay Howe's presentational video, <a href="http://confreaks.com/videos/2230-html5tx2013-front-end-legos-better-design-with-reusable-html-css">"Front End Legos: Better Design with Reusable HTML & CSS"</a>, he asserts that code must be maintained through organized and modular performance. Performance allows the reuse of code, not the duplication but the removal of old code. Its interesting that Shay Howe says to stay away from copying and pasting code when you can organize and modulate a more concise way of presentation - someone could have separate CSS documents for each page of his/her website as to allow a lower specificity when someone requests and loads to page or combine similar CSS files.</p>
    <p>I had conflicted feelings about this video. I understand what I have learned about HTML and CSS. However, Shay Howe presents some very interesting ideas about how to better use HTML and CSS to web design. I don't know if it would be worthwhile to change CSS for all those who know and use it, but standards need to evolve (like technology and language) to help future designers in their fields.</p>
    <h4>Three Things I learned:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Specificity determines which CSS styles are applied to an element.</li>
        <li>Data URI is a Uniform Resource Identifier scheme that creates performance enhancement, regardless of Internet connection, by removing a browsers limited requests that become stuck in a bottleneck of demanded data.</li>
        <li>Specificity can be measured by IDs, Classes/Pseudo-classes/Attributes, and Elements.. High specificity is applied before low specificity, but the goal is to have the lowest specificity through unnecessary nesting.</li>
    </ol>
