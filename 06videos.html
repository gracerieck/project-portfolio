    <h1>A Video Review</h1>
    
    <h2>“Don’t Fear the Internet”</h2>
    <h3>by Russ Maschmeyer (aka ‘Strange Native’)</h3>
    <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
    <p>The Internet influences many aspects of our daily lives in society today. As such, it is important to know how the Internet and websites work. Ignorance is no excuse when it come to a vastly used resource and commodity. </p>
    <p>I really enjoyed the  <a href="http://vimeo.com/24006296">"Don't Fear the Internet"</a> tutorial videos. Russ Maschmeyer (aka ‘Strange Native’) has a very articulate voice and does an excellent job of explaining and teaching about the Internet, websites, HTML, CSS, and more. I would definitely recommend these videos to anyone attempting to learn HTML or CSS, or to anyone who simply wants to learn more about how website work and are designed. The tutorials can empower non-web designers and make them more comfortable with the platform they are now manipulating.</p>
    <p>These tutorial videos reaffirmed wheat I have been learning in Web Design class. Furthermore, Russ Maschmeyer has taught me that I don't need to be a designer, photographer, or creative person to build my own (good-looking) website.</p>
    <h4>Three Things I learned:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>A website is a series of files stored on a server, located at a web address, that anyone can find with a computer. There are two kinds of websites: static and dynamic.</li>
        <li>CSS has a limited set of properties that can be used to style (just like HTML has a limited set of elements that define content types).</li>
        <li>Pseudo elements can be added on to the selector properties used in CSS to style specific parts or properties of an element.</li>
    </ol>
